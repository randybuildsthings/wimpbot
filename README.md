WIMP IRC bot, written in Node.js

WIMP (http://beawimp.org) is an unnetworking group comprising designers, developers, marketers, videographers, photographers, and anyone else that has a hand in digital media.

As part of that, WIMP has created an IRC channel, #wimp, that is available to any and all members who are interested in helping each other out on a variety of levels. To assist in this IRC endeavor, wimpbot will keep the #wimp channel (or channels, depending on growth) a tidy and civilized place to network and get questions answered with a minimum of difficulty.

As the IRC bot grows in complexity, we will work to ensure that new functions are tempered by a test-driven philosophy, so things work without breaking IRC and getting the bot banned.

Remember, ask a person, not a search engine.
